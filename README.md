# PerfectNumbers
Version 1.14.  First implementation in Visual Studio.
In number theory, a perfect number is one whose factors addd to twice the number, or one whose factors (minus the number) add to the number.
The first perfect number is 6: 1 + 2 + 3 = 6.  The second is 28: 1 + 2 + 4 + 7 + 14 = 28.
Perfect numbers are of the form 2^x - 2^y, which drastically cuts down on the numbers that need testing.
This program generates all the perfect numbers that will fit into four bytes (a longword).
